# Deploy a Spring Cloud Task application using Data Flow

In this section, we will demonstrate how to register a Spring Cloud Task application with Data Flow, create a task definition, and launch the task on Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes and your local machine.

## Development

For this guide, we will use the [simple task](/documentation/batch-developer-guides/batch/simple-task) sample Spring Cloud Task application, called `billsetuptask`.
Follow the instructions to code and build the task if you have not done so already.
We will register a task application, create a simple task definition, and launch the task using the Data Flow Server.
The Data Flow Server provides a comprehensive [API](http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#api-guide) to perform the necessary steps.
The Data Flow server includes a Data Flow Dashboard web UI client. In addition there is a [Data Flow Shell](http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#shell) CLI, available as separate download.
The CLI and the UI both expose the complete API functionality.
Which one to use is a matter of preference, but the UI is quite nice so we will feature it here.

### The Data Flow Dashboard

Assuming Data Flow is [installed](installation/) and running on one of the supported platforms, open your browser at `<data-flow-url>/dashboard`. Here, `<data-flow-url>` depends on the platform. Consult the [installation guide](/installation) to determining the base URL for your installation. If Data Flow is running on your local machine, go to http://localhost:9393/dashboard.

### Application Registration

The Data Flow Dashboard will land on the Application Registration view where we will register the sample task.

#### Application Registration Concepts

Applications in Data Flow are registered as named resources so that they may be referenced when using the Data Flow DSL to configure and compose tasks.
Registration associates a logical application name and type with a physical resource, given by a URI.
The URI conforms to a [schema](http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#spring-cloud-dataflow-register-stream-apps) and may represent a Maven artifact, a Docker image, or an actual `http(s)` or `file` URL.
Data Flow defines a some logical application types which indicate its role as a streaming component, a task, or a standalone application.
Spring Cloud Task applications, as you might guess, are always registered as a `task` type.

##### Maven Artifacts

The URI for a Maven artifact is generally of the form `maven://<groupId>:<artifactId>:<version>`.

The maven URI for the sample app is:

```
maven://io.spring:billsetuptask:1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT
```

The `maven:` protocol specifies a Maven artifact which is resolved using the remote and local Maven repositories configured for the Data Flow Server.

##### Docker Images

The URI for a Docker Image is of the form `docker:<docker-image-path>/<imageName>:<version>` and is resolved using the Docker registry configured for the Data Flow task platform and image pull policy.

The Docker URI for the sample app is:

```
docker:springcloudtask/billsetuptask:1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT
```

#### Registering an Application

To register an application, select `Add Applications` and `Register one or more applications`. Fill in the form, as shown, and hit `Register the application(s)`.

### Create Task Definition

Select `Tasks` from the left navigation bar, then select `Create task(s)`.
This displays a graphical editor that we can use to compose tasks.
The initial canvas contains `START` and `END` nodes. To the left of the canvas, we see the available task applications, including `bill-setup-task` which we just registered.
Simply drag that task to the canvas and connect the task to the START and END nodes to complete the task definition.
In this case, the task definition consists of a single task application.
If the app defined configuration properties, we would set them here.

![Create the billsetup task definition](images/SCDF-create-task.png)

Click on `Create Task`.
This will prompt you to name the task definition, which is the logical name for the runtime configuration we will to deploy.
In this case, we will use the same name as the task application.

![Confirm create task](images/SCDF-confirm-create-task.png)

Press `Create the task`.
This will display the main `Tasks` view.

## Launch the Task

![Launch the task](images/SCDF-launch-task.png)

Now we will launch the task by pressing the `play` button (that's the middle icon that looks like an arrow head pointing right).
This will take you to a form where you can add command line arguments and deployment parameters, but we don't need any for this task.
Press `Launch the task` and stand back!
This will run the task on the Data Flow server's task platform and record a new task `execution`.
When the execution is complete, the Status will turn to a satisfying green color and show `Complete.`
Select the `Executions` tab to view a summary of executions for this task.

### Local

get the jar run it bla

### Cloud Foundry

As Alana I must ask for an org/space

### Kubernetes

Run the [sample task on Kubernetes](/documentation/batch-developer-guides/batch/data-flow-simple-task-kubernetes/).
